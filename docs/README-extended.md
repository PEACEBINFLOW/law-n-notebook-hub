# Law-N Notebook Hub — Extended Notes

This repo is the **practical layer** under the Law-N series:

- Post #1 — Thesis
- Post #2 — Manifesto
- Post #3 — Opening the Signal-Native Stack
- This repo — **“OK, now show me the notebooks.”**

The 8 core Law-N repos define **APIs, specs, engines and sims**.

This hub does 3 things:

1. Turn those ideas into **reproducible notebooks**
2. Keep **datasets** in one place
3. Make it easy to **publish to Kaggle** without breaking the repo structure

As you build:

- Keep `docs/notebook-index.md` updated
- Use `docs/architecture.md` to explain how a new notebook ties back to a specific repo or spec
